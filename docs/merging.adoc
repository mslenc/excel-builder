== Merging Cells

This module supports merging cells with an easy to use API.

[source,groovy]
----
row {
    merge {
        //Anything you can do inside row directly
        cell("Foo")
        skipCells(5)
    }
}
----

WARNING: Only one call to `cell()` is allowed inside a merge.

You can also apply default styling to the merged cells

[source,groovy]
----
row {
    merge(font: Font.BOLD) {
        //Anything you can do inside row directly
        cell("Foo")
        skipCells(3)
    }
}
----

If you only have one piece of data, but want that data to account for multiple columns, you can pass a number to the merge method.

[source,groovy]
----
row {
    //The value "Foo" will span 3 columns
    merge("Foo", 3)
}
----

You can also apply default styling to the merged cells created in that way

[source,groovy]
----
row {
    merge("Foo", 3, [font: Font.BOLD])
}
